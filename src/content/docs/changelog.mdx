## v0.4.2 — 2026-02-22

**SDK patch release — adapter fixes and async compatibility**

### Fixes

- **LangChain adapter** — Add missing callback protocol attributes (`ignore_agent`, `ignore_retry`, `raise_error`) required by LangChain's `BaseCallbackHandler` interface. Handle LangGraph `AIMessage` and `ToolMessage` output formats so traces capture tool-call responses correctly.
- **expect() DSL** — Accept `Trace` directly in addition to `AgentResult`. Auto-wraps into `AgentResult` for manual adapter workflows that build traces via `TraceBuilder` without going through a provider adapter.
- **Plugin fixture** — Run the engine event loop in a background daemon thread with `run_coroutine_threadsafe()` bridge. Fixes `Future attached to a different loop` errors when pytest-asyncio tests (e.g., google-adk) call into the engine from a separate event loop.

### Upgrade

```bash
uv add attest-ai@latest
```

### Notes

- **No engine changes.** The Go engine binary remains at v0.4.0. `ENGINE_VERSION` is unchanged; auto-download continues to fetch v0.4.0 binaries.

---

## v0.4.1 — 2026-02-21

**SDK patch release — engine auto-download**

### Features

- **Engine auto-download** — Both Python and TypeScript SDKs now automatically download the `attest-engine` binary from GitHub Releases on first use. No manual binary setup required after `uv add attest-ai` or `pnpm add @attest-ai/core`.
- **SHA256 verification** — Downloaded binaries are verified against `checksums-sha256.txt` from the release. Checksum mismatch aborts the download with a clear error.
- **Version-pinned cache** — Binaries are cached at `~/.attest/bin/` with a `.engine-version` marker. SDK version mismatch triggers automatic re-download.
- **Discovery chain** — Engine binary resolution follows a predictable order:

    ```
    ATTEST_ENGINE_PATH env var
      → PATH lookup
      → ~/.attest/bin/ (shared cache, version-checked)
      → ../../bin/ (monorepo dev layout)
      → ./bin/ (local)
      → auto-download from GitHub Releases
      → actionable error message
    ```

- **Opt-out** — Set `ATTEST_ENGINE_NO_DOWNLOAD=1` to disable network access. The error message explains alternative installation methods.

### Fixes

- **pytest plugin** — `pytest.skip()` replaced with `pytest.fail()` when the engine binary is missing. With auto-download in place, silent skipping is no longer appropriate; real errors are now surfaced.
- **TypeScript VERSION** — Corrected from `0.3.0` to `0.4.1`.

### Other

- **Examples moved** — All example projects relocated to [`attest-framework/attest-examples`](https://github.com/attest-framework/attest-examples) for independent versioning. A redirect README remains in the main repo.

### Install / Upgrade

#### Python

```bash
uv add attest-ai
```

#### TypeScript

```bash
pnpm add @attest-ai/core
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `ATTEST_ENGINE_PATH` | Absolute path to engine binary — skips all discovery | unset |
| `ATTEST_ENGINE_NO_DOWNLOAD` | `1` / `true` / `yes` disables auto-download | unset (enabled) |
